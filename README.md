# webScraper

### Description

This project is an efficient data handling and web scraping solution that leverages Sequelize, Node.js, and Puppeteer. It's specifically designed to automate the process of web scraping, extracting data in real-time, and storing it in a structured manner. The extracted data is stored in various formats, such as XML, XLSX, and JSON, and is dynamically inserted into a MySQL database. This integration with MySQL allows for robust and scalable data storage, making the system well-suited for handling large volumes of data. The use of Puppeteer automates the web browser, enabling seamless scraping and retrieval of data from various web sources. Sequelize, a powerful ORM for Node.js, streamlines the process of connecting, querying, and managing the MySQL database. This project is ideal for anyone needing an automated, reliable solution for web scraping and efficient data storage and management.
